# Simple_Eulers_Method_Code
This is straightforward code I have generated using the Euler Method Algorithm. This is for my differential equations class I am currently teaching online. If you have any questions, please let me know. There are numerous examples so you can play with what functions you can use, what step sizes to implement, and labeling the initial condition
